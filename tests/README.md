For tests the structure should follow:

Acceptance Tests:
These should be specific user journey's to acheive an action, going likely from page to page, likely using Playwright.

Integration Tests;
Should test multiple functions together, with as little mocking as possible, likely testing a whole route.

Unit Tests;
Individual Functions.
